This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to late binding and type mismatches.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a solution using proper type checking.  Late binding, while flexible, requires diligent type verification to prevent runtime failures.  The solution emphasizes the importance of explicit type checking before accessing object properties or methods.
